# Profile of restaurants in Toronto

### Motivation 
In this project, I chose a diverse pool of restaurants in the City of Toronto and created a profile of their diversity by location and patterns of response to reviewers. 


### Data collection
I used recommendations from TripAdvisor and scraped 2100 restaurant names and cuisine types in Toronto. I then used Google Places API to find place ID, geographical location, rating, business status, review and response content, and number of reviews for this list.


### Exploratoy Data Analysis (EDA)
I studied common cuisine types by location (Toronto, North York, Etobicoke, and Scarborough) and the relationship between rating, reviews, and response rates. I also studeid semantic complexity across restaurants with different cuisine types.


### NLP and Machine Learning (in progress)
Developing basic and aspect-based sentiment analysis models
