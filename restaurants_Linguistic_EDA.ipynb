Our prices reflect the quality of the ingredients we use and the labour required to pay those who make and serve it fair wages.

The portion sizes have remained the same - if you're able to write us with the specific time/date that you came in, we can work to figure this out with you.  In terms of the prices, the small Beach Bowl used to be $14.50. The same size bowl is now $15.50. It's been increased by $1. $19.50 is the price for the current large bowl. The old price (for the large bowl) was $18.50.  We understand that the price increase on certain menu items is frustrating, but we wanted to explain to you why it had to happen. You may notice that there wasn't a blanket price increase across the board. That's because we looked at the cost of every ingredient within each menu item and only increased the items where our suppliers have increased the pricing to us. In order for us to provide the best possible experience for our guests, we ensure that we pay our staff a live-able wage and also provide them with a robust healthcare benefits plan. When you combine raises in rent, food costs, labour and other overhead costs, these increases are essential in keeping Fresh functioning.  We hope that that helps to answer your questions.\",\n",
